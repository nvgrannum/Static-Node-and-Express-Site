          p This is my elevator pitch. It is the elevator pitch to end all elevator pitches. Your mind is blown. Your mortal brain can scarcely process how well my prior experience maps to your open dev position. 
          p Now that THAT is out of the way, a mechanical engineer by degree and by trade (until this year), I have always loved learning new things and needed to find a career that suited that. I adopt new ideas and techniques quickly and think outside the box.
          p I have led work projects and company organizations with dozens of people. Organized office-wide and global initiatives for environmental sustainability and fundraisers.
          p This <strong><i>is</i></strong> the employee you are looking for.
