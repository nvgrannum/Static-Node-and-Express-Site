          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p This is my elevator pitch. It is the elevator pitch to end all elevator pitches. Your mind is blown. Your mortal brain can scarcely process how well my prior experience maps to your open dev position. 
          p Now that THAT is out of the way, a mechanical engineer by degree and by trade (until my career switch this year), I have always loved learning new things and needed to find a career that suited that. Development is a field that is constantly growing and changing and is perfect for someone aiming for new challenges.
          p I have led work projects and company organizations with dozens of people. Organized office-wide and global initiatives for environmental sustainability and fundraisers.
          p I am passionate about sustainability, promoting diversity, adaptability, and learning new things. I adopt new ideas and techniques quickly and think outside the box.
          p This <strong><i>is</i></strong> the employee you are looking for.
